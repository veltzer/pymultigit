I have a bunch of python projects: project1, project2, ... all under the same folder.
I can create a virtual env for each of them but that takes too much disk space.
So I created one big environment for all of them together.
In order for that big env to have all the modules that all projects needed I concatenated
the requiremets (and uniqued them) and installed them all using
"uv pip install -r concatenated.txt".

Now I want to create a lock file for each of the projects.
I want the lock file to be created with something like:
	$ uv pip compile "requirements.thawed.txt" --no-annotate --no-header > "requirements.txt"
But this will calculated the requirements with no regard to the other projects.
How can I create a lock file per project but still have all those lock files match each other
in terms of versinos?
