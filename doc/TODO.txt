- add command which upgrades python modules for each repo where that python
	module actually exists.
- add option so silence output (both stdout and stderr) when doing
	mg clean
	mg build
- add feature to build the
	venvs.
	(currently we do not know how to build them).
- add feature: mg pydmt build
- add feature: mg compare_files
	and all other mg_*.sh commands.
- what about -j 8 or something when doing build with make.
	find a way to setup to do parallel make with mg.
- allow to rebuild the virtual envrionments for all project as part of
	mg build.
	* maybe even add command just to build the virtual environments.
- enable to upgrade or install a certain version of a module in
	all repositories:
	$ mg upgrade pydmt
	will go into every repository, check if it has pydmt and will upgrade it.
- enable to do something like this:
	$ mg grep click -- requirements.txt
	this requires that pytconf support extra arguments after -- to be collected and
	accessible to the command being run.
- enable to just list matching projects when doing 'grep'.
	much like -l to git grep
- make 'pull' do stuff in parallel.
	This would be much faster when I have lots of repos.
- make 'clean' be based on gitpython and not command line.
