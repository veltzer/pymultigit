- make "pymultigit status" be silent and only report projects which
	have issues.
	it should show the project and the output afterwards.
- enable to upgrade or install a certain version of a module in
	all repositories:
	$ mg upgrade pydmt
	will go into every repository, check if it has pydmt and will upgrade it.
- enable to do something like this:
	$ mg grep click -- requirements.txt
	this requires that pytconf support extra arguments after -- to be collected and
	accessible to the command being run.
- enable to just list matching projects when doing 'grep'.
	much like -l to git grep
- make 'pull' do stuff in parallel.
	This would be much faster when I have lots of repos.
- make 'clean' be based on gitpython and not command line.
