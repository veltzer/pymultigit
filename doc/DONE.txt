- make this project do all that the scripts in the "scripts" folder do.
	I removed this TODO items because I don't know what it means
- make "pymultigit status" be silent and only report projects which
	have issues.
	it should show the project and the output afterwards.
- currently
	$ mg build_pydmt
	runs pydmt with the system/user python and not the virtual env
	python.
	add an option:
	$ mg build_venv_pydmt
	that runs pydmt build inside the venv.
